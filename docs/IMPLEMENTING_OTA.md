# Implementing Custom OTA

Here's a 101 guide on adding UN1CA's old ota stuff into your ROM.

---

## Implement Custom OTA

> ðŸ’¡ Check out the reference manifest:  
> [**Click here to view the reference manifest**](https://github.com/ayumi-aiko/Tsukika/blob/main/updaterConfigs/ref/ota-manifest.xml)

---

## Downloading the Manifest

- Copy the contents of the reference manifest.
- Create a new file (e.g., `ota-gta7-manifest.xml`) and paste the contents inside.

---

## Editing the Manifest

Make sure to customize these fields:

- `<RomName>` â†’ Your ROMâ€™s name.
- `<VersionName>` â†’ Your version codename (e.g., `Eternal Bless`).
- `<BuildNumber>` â†’ Date format: `YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `20250614`).
- `<DownloadURL>` â†’ **Direct download link** to the OTA zip.
- `<AndroidVer>` â†’ Android version (e.g., `14`).
- `<OneUIVer>` â†’ OneUI version (e.g., `6`).
- `<CheckMD5>` â†’ The MD5 checksum of your OTA zip.
- `<FileSize>` â†’ File size in bytes.
- `<ChangelogHeader>` â†’ Image link for the update banner (`1280Ã—720` recommended).
- `<ChangelogURL>` â†’ Link to a hosted changelog text file.

## Compiling the OTA Updater App

Thanks to [UN1CA](https://github.com/salvogiangri/UN1CA/) for the base OTA app.

1. Push your manifest to GitHub (in a public repo).
2. Get the **raw** URL by clicking the file and appending `?raw=true` to the URL.
3. Open the Makefile at the root of the repo and change the **signing key path**.
4. Run this command to compile:
5. Set SkipSign=false if you want the APK signed.

   ```bash
   make OTA_MANIFEST_URL="paste the raw URL here" SkipSign=true UN1CAUpdater
   ```

## Deploying OTA Updater into the ROM

Copy the compiled APK:
```
./src/tsukika/packages/TsukikaUpdater/dist/TsukikaUpdater-aligned-signed.apk
```
Push it into your ROMâ€™s /system/app directory.

- ```ro.tsukika.buildid``` This property is the main source to check update. without this in your ROM, the updater won't have a way to figure out what's latest and what's not.
- ```ro.tsukika.codename``` This property name is itself self-explanatory.

And that's pretty much it.
